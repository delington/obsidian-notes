**Project:**

Streaming service for medical (surgeon operation) purposes with Java Back End and Angular2 Front End.

The main picture is that an instructor or major surgeon would like to teach residents but not all of them has place next to the operating table. 

For this he/she create an event by the application (which can be free or paid) and will stream the operation with a high quality camera. Meanwhile the instructor's assistant can mark and text note the video at certain places for teaching purposes. (Phase 1)

After the instructor finished his/her session the residents can stream back their own operation to the instructor and both of them can mark and text this video, because the doctor can switch in the students streams. (Phase 2)

In the next section everyone watch back the instructor's recorded video while they can have conversations in a chat window. (Phase3)

Under all of section there is a chat window where the instructor and its assistant can communicate with the residents in private or in global chat. After all phase the students can download their own recorded video and the major surgeons.
